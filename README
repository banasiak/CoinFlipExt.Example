How to create your own add-on coin package for Simple Coin Flip 5.0+

1. Checkout this open-source code to use as a template.

2. Add your coins to the res/values/arrays.xml file.
   a. The first array contains the descriptive name that is displayed to the user.
   b. The second array contains the unique prefix associated with this coin.
      i. Although not required, a UUID prefix is preferred, as to not collide
         with other third-party add-in coin packages.

3. You can add as many coins as you like to this package, following these guidelines:
   a. Each coin requires a "heads", "tails", and "edge" image.
   b. Each coin should be provided in both a HDPI and MDPI resolution.
      i.  HDPI: 390x390 px - 96 dpi - 32-bit PNG
      ii. MDPI: 250x250 px - 96 dpi - 32-bit PNG
   c. The area around the coin image should be transparent.

4. The coin images should be named using the following format:
   a. UUID_heads.png | UUID_tails.png | UUID_edge.png
   b. If several coins share a common image, such as "edge.png" an XML bitmap 
      reference can be used to save space instead of including duplicate images.

5. Your package should be named with "coinflipext" somewhere in the namespace.
   a. For example: com.banasiak.coinflipext.example
                   com.robotsidekick.android.coinflipext.australia

6. Finally, please be sure to test your package, particularly before publishing
   to the Android Market.  If you would like my help/blessing/whatever, feel 
   free to send me an e-mail, I'll be glad to help.
